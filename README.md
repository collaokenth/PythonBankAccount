**Humber Bank Terminal**

The Humber Bank Terminal is a Python-based project that simulates a basic banking terminal interface. It allows users to interact with their bank accounts by logging in with a 4-digit PIN and performing various account operations, including checking balances, making withdrawals, and deposits. The project is designed to provide a straightforward banking experience for users and is implemented using the `BankAccount` class.

**Future Enhancements:** I have plans to further enhance this project by implementing a database system. This addition will enable the secure storage of user account information, transaction histories, and other relevant data. The incorporation of a database will enhance data management, security, and scalability, making the Humber Bank Terminal even more robust and user-friendly.
